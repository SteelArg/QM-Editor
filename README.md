## Overview
**QM Editor** is an isometric grid **GIFs generator**, designed for a chat-based game **Quizzer Madness**.
You have the ability to create and edit a grid of tiles with characters and objects on it.
Then you can export your artwork as a GIF to use in a chat-game or anywhere else for visuals.
